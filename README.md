# process + documentation #
for this assignment i wanted to create a digital collage of a dinner table. i used the index.html page from my web art midterm and modified the text as well as place the CSS into the HTML file directly.

my inspiration comes from my hometown of san antonio, tx that has a rich culture of its own influenced by its natives whose roots lie in latin america. my favorite part of home is the food! >:) 

# challenges + struggles #
i struggled and coninue to struggle with the remote git pushing and setup.
